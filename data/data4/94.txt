Data preparation involves transforming raw data into a form that is more appropriate for modeling.
Preparing data may be the most important part of a predictive modeling project and the most time-consuming, although it seems to be the least discussed. Instead, the focus is on machine learning algorithms, whose usage and parameterization has become quite routine.
Practical data preparation requires knowledge of data cleaning, feature selection data transforms, dimensionality reduction, and more.
In this crash course, you will discover how you can get started and confidently prepare data for a predictive modeling project with Python in seven days.
This is a big and important post. You might want to bookmark it.
Kick-start your project with my new book Data Preparation for Machine Learning, including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples.
Let’s get started.

# Who Is This Crash-Course For?
Before we get started, let’s make sure you are in the right place.
This course is for developers who may know some applied machine learning. Maybe you know how to work through a predictive modeling problem end to end, or at least most of the main steps, with popular tools.
The lessons in this course do assume a few things about you, such as:
- You know your way around basic Python for programming.
- You may know some basic NumPy for array manipulation.
- You may know some basic scikit-learn for modeling.
You do NOT need to be:
- A math wiz!
- A machine learning expert!
This crash course will take you from a developer who knows a little machine learning to a developer who can effectively and competently prepare data for a predictive modeling project.
Note: This crash course assumes you have a working Python 3 SciPy environment with at least NumPy installed. If you need help with your environment, you can follow the step-by-step tutorial here:
- How to Set Up Your Python Environment for Machine Learning With Anaconda
# Crash-Course Overview
This crash course is broken down into seven lessons.
You could complete one lesson per day (recommended) or complete all of the lessons in one day (hardcore). It really depends on the time you have available and your level of enthusiasm.
Below is a list of the seven lessons that will get you started and productive with data preparation in Python:
- Lesson 01: Importance of Data Preparation
- Lesson 02: Fill Missing Values With Imputation
- Lesson 03: Select Features With RFE
- Lesson 04: Scale Data With Normalization
- Lesson 05: Transform Categories With One-Hot Encoding
- Lesson 06: Transform Numbers to Categories With kBins
- Lesson 07: Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
Each lesson could take you 60 seconds or up to 30 minutes. Take your time and complete the lessons at your own pace. Ask questions and even post results in the comments below.
The lessons might expect you to go off and find out how to do things. I will give you hints, but part of the point of each lesson is to force you to learn where to go to look for help with and about the algorithms and the best-of-breed tools in Python. (Hint: I have all of the answers on this blog; use the search box.)
Post your results in the comments; I’ll cheer you on!
Hang in there; don’t give up.




# Lesson 01: Importance of Data Preparation
In this lesson, you will discover the importance of data preparation in predictive modeling with machine learning.
Predictive modeling projects involve learning from data.
Data refers to examples or cases from the domain that characterize the problem you want to solve.
On a predictive modeling project, such as classification or regression, raw data typically cannot be used directly.
There are four main reasons why this is the case:
- Data Types: Machine learning algorithms require data to be numbers.
- Data Requirements: Some machine learning algorithms impose requirements on the data.
- Data Errors: Statistical noise and errors in the data may need to be corrected.
- Data Complexity: Complex nonlinear relationships may be teased out of the data.
The raw data must be pre-processed prior to being used to fit and evaluate a machine learning model. This step in a predictive modeling project is referred to as “data preparation.”
There are common or standard tasks that you may use or explore during the data preparation step in a machine learning project.
These tasks include:
- Data Cleaning: Identifying and correcting mistakes or errors in the data.
- Feature Selection: Identifying those input variables that are most relevant to the task.
- Data Transforms: Changing the scale or distribution of variables.
- Feature Engineering: Deriving new variables from available data.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Creating compact projections of the data.
Each of these tasks is a whole field of study with specialized algorithms.
For this lesson, you must list three data preparation algorithms that you know of or may have used before and give a one-line summary for its purpose.
One example of a data preparation algorithm is data normalization that scales numerical variables to the range between zero and one.
Post your answer in the comments below. I would love to see what you come up with.
In the next lesson, you will discover how to fix data that has missing values, called data imputation.
# Lesson 02: Fill Missing Values With Imputation
In this lesson, you will discover how to identify and fill missing values in data.
Real-world data often has missing values.
Data can have missing values for a number of reasons, such as observations that were not recorded and data corruption. Handling missing data is important as many machine learning algorithms do not support data with missing values.
Filling missing values with data is called data imputation and a popular approach for data imputation is to calculate a statistical value for each column (such as a mean) and replace all missing values for that column with the statistic.
The horse colic dataset describes medical characteristics of horses with colic and whether they lived or died. It has missing values marked with a question mark ‘?’. We can load the dataset with the read_csv() function and ensure that question mark values are marked as NaN.
Once loaded, we can use the SimpleImputer class to transform all missing values marked with a NaN value with the mean of the column.
The complete example is listed below.

For this lesson, you must run the example and review the number of missing values in the dataset before and after the data imputation transform.

In the next lesson, you will discover how to select the most important features in a dataset.
# Lesson 03: Select Features With RFE
In this lesson, you will discover how to select the most important features in a dataset.
Feature selection is the process of reducing the number of input variables when developing a predictive model.
It is desirable to reduce the number of input variables to both reduce the computational cost of modeling and, in some cases, to improve the performance of the model.
Recursive Feature Elimination, or RFE for short, is a popular feature selection algorithm.
RFE is popular because it is easy to configure and use and because it is effective at selecting those features (columns) in a training dataset that are more or most relevant in predicting the target variable.
The scikit-learn Python machine learning library provides an implementation of RFE for machine learning. RFE is a transform. To use it, first, the class is configured with the chosen algorithm specified via the “estimator” argument and the number of features to select via the “n_features_to_select” argument.
The example below defines a synthetic classification dataset with five redundant input features. RFE is then used to select five features using the decision tree algorithm.

For this lesson, you must run the example and review which features were selected and the relative ranking that each input feature was assigned.
Post your answer in the comments below. I would love to see what you come up with.
In the next lesson, you will discover how to scale numerical data.
# Lesson 04: Scale Data With Normalization
In this lesson, you will discover how to scale numerical data for machine learning.
Many machine learning algorithms perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range.
This includes algorithms that use a weighted sum of the input, like linear regression, and algorithms that use distance measures, like k-nearest neighbors.
One of the most popular techniques for scaling numerical data prior to modeling is normalization. Normalization scales each input variable separately to the range 0-1, which is the range for floating-point values where we have the most precision. It requires that you know or are able to accurately estimate the minimum and maximum observable values for each variable. You may be able to estimate these values from your available data.
You can normalize your dataset using the scikit-learn object MinMaxScaler.
The example below defines a synthetic classification dataset, then uses the MinMaxScaler to normalize the input variables.

For this lesson, you must run the example and report the scale of the input variables both prior to and then after the normalization transform.
For bonus points, calculate the minimum and maximum of each variable before and after the transform to confirm it was applied as expected.

In the next lesson, you will discover how to transform categorical variables to numbers.
# Lesson 05: Transform Categories With One-Hot Encoding
In this lesson, you will discover how to encode categorical input variables as numbers.
Machine learning models require all input and output variables to be numeric. This means that if your data contains categorical data, you must encode it to numbers before you can fit and evaluate a model.
One of the most popular techniques for transforming categorical variables into numbers is the one-hot encoding.
Categorical data are variables that contain label values rather than numeric values.
Each label for a categorical variable can be mapped to a unique integer, called an ordinal encoding. Then, a one-hot encoding can be applied to the ordinal representation. This is where one new binary variable is added to the dataset for each unique integer value in the variable, and the original categorical variable is removed from the dataset.
For example, imagine we have a “color” variable with three categories (‘red‘, ‘green‘, and ‘blue‘). In this case, three binary variables are needed. A “1” value is placed in the binary variable for the color and “0” values for the other colors.
For example:
This one-hot encoding transform is available in the scikit-learn Python machine learning library via the OneHotEncoder class.
The breast cancer dataset contains only categorical input variables.
The example below loads the dataset and one hot encodes each of the categorical input variables.

For this lesson, you must run the example and report on the raw data before the transform, and the impact on the data after the one-hot encoding was applied.
Post your answer in the comments below. I would love to see what you come up with.
In the next lesson, you will discover how to transform numerical variables into categories.
# Lesson 06: Transform Numbers to Categories With kBins
In this lesson, you will discover how to transform numerical variables into categorical variables.
Some machine learning algorithms may prefer or require categorical or ordinal input variables, such as some decision tree and rule-based algorithms.
This could be caused by outliers in the data, multi-modal distributions, highly exponential distributions, and more.
Many machine learning algorithms prefer or perform better when numerical input variables with non-standard distributions are transformed to have a new distribution or an entirely new data type.
One approach is to use the transform of the numerical variable to have a discrete probability distribution where each numerical value is assigned a label and the labels have an ordered (ordinal) relationship.
This is called a discretization transform and can improve the performance of some machine learning models for datasets by making the probability distribution of numerical input variables discrete.
The discretization transform is available in the scikit-learn Python machine learning library via the KBinsDiscretizer class.
It allows you to specify the number of discrete bins to create (n_bins), whether the result of the transform will be an ordinal or one-hot encoding (encode), and the distribution used to divide up the values of the variable (strategy), such as ‘uniform.’
The example below creates a synthetic input variable with 10 numerical input variables, then encodes each into 10 discrete bins with an ordinal encoding.

For this lesson, you must run the example and report on the raw data before the transform, and then the effect the transform had on the data.
For bonus points, explore alternate configurations of the transform, such as different strategies and number of bins.
Post your answer in the comments below. I would love to see what you come up with.
In the next lesson, you will discover how to reduce the dimensionality of input data.
# Lesson 07: Dimensionality Reduction With PCA
In this lesson, you will discover how to use dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of input variables in a dataset.
The number of input variables or features for a dataset is referred to as its dimensionality.
Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset.
More input features often make a predictive modeling task more challenging to model, more generally referred to as the curse of dimensionality.
Although on high-dimensionality statistics, dimensionality reduction techniques are often used for data visualization, these techniques can be used in applied machine learning to simplify a classification or regression dataset in order to better fit a predictive model.
Perhaps the most popular technique for dimensionality reduction in machine learning is Principal Component Analysis, or PCA for short. This is a technique that comes from the field of linear algebra and can be used as a data preparation technique to create a projection of a dataset prior to fitting a model.
The resulting dataset, the projection, can then be used as input to train a machine learning model.
The scikit-learn library provides the PCA class that can be fit on a dataset and used to transform a training dataset and any additional datasets in the future.
The example below creates a synthetic binary classification dataset with 10 input variables then uses PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to the three most important components.

For this lesson, you must run the example and report on the structure and form of the raw dataset and the dataset after the transform was applied.
For bonus points, explore transforms with different numbers of selected components.
