Data preparation is the transformation of raw data into a form that is more appropriate for modeling.
It is a challenging topic to discuss as the data differs in form, type, and structure from project to project.
Nevertheless, there are common data preparation tasks across projects. It is a huge field of study and goes by many names, such as “data cleaning,” “data wrangling,” “data preprocessing,” “feature engineering,” and more. Some of these are distinct data preparation tasks, and some of the terms are used to describe the entire data preparation process.
Even though it is a challenging topic to discuss, there are a number of books on the topic.
In this post, you will discover the top books on data cleaning, data preparation, feature engineering, and related topics.
Let’s get started.
Kick-start your project with my new book Data Preparation for Machine Learning, including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples.
# Overview
The focus here is on data preparation for tabular data, e.g. data in the form of a table with rows and columns as it looks in an excel spreadsheet.
Data preparation is an important topic for all data types, although specialty methods are required for each, such as image data in computer vision, text data in natural language processing, and sequence data in time series forecasting.
Data preparation is often a chapter in a machine learning textbook, although there are books dedicated to the topic. We will focus on these books.
I have gathered all the books I can find on the topic data preparation, selected what I think are the best or better books, and organized them into three groups; they are:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Wrangling
- Feature Engineering
I will try to give the flavor of each book, including the goal, the table of contents, and where to learn more about it.




# Data Cleaning
Data cleaning refers to identifying and fixing errors in the data prior to modeling, including, but not limited to, outliers, missing values, and much more.
The top books on data cleaning include:
- Bad Data Handbook: Cleaning Up The Data So You Can Get Back To Work, 2012.
- Best Practices in Data Cleaning: A Complete Guide to Everything You Need to Do Before and After Collecting Your Data, 2012.
- Data Cleaning, 2019.
Let’s take a closer look at each in turn.
The book “Bad Data Handbook: Cleaning Up The Data So You Can Get Back To Work” was edited by Q. Ethan Mccallum and was published in 2012.
Bad data is described not only as corrupt data but any data that impairs the modeling process.
It’s tough to nail down a precise definition of “Bad Data.” Some people consider it a purely hands-on, technical phenomenon: missing values, malformed records, and cranky file formats. Sure, that’s part of the picture, but Bad Data is so much more. […] Bad Data is data that gets in the way.
— Page 1, “Bad Data Handbook: Cleaning Up The Data So You Can Get Back To Work,” 2012.
It is a collection of essays by 19 machine learning practitioners and us full of useful nuggets on data preparation and management.

The book “Best Practices in Data Cleaning: A Complete Guide to Everything You Need to Do Before and After Collecting Your Data” was written by Jason Osborne and was published in 2012.
This is a more general textbook on data preparation for computational-based social sciences rather than machine learning specifically. Nevertheless, it contains a ton of useful advice.
My goal in writing this book is to collect, in one place, a systematic overview of what I consider to be best practices in data cleaning—things I can demonstrate as making a difference in your data analyses. I seek to change the status quo, the current state of affairs in quantitative research in the social sciences (and beyond).

The book “Data Cleaning” was written by Ihab Ilyas and Xu Chu, and published in 2019.
As the name suggests, the book is focused on data cleaning techniques that fix errors in raw data prior to modeling.
Data cleaning is used to refer to all kinds of tasks and activities to detect and repair errors in the data. Rather than focus on a particular data cleaning task, in this book, we give an overview of the end-to-end data cleaning process, describing various error detection and repair methods, and attempt to anchor these proposals with multiple taxonomies and views.

# Feature Engineering
Feature engineering refers to creating new input variables from raw data, although it also refers to data preparation more generally.
Top books on feature engineering include:
- Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models, 2019.
- Feature Engineering for Machine Learning: Principles and Techniques for Data Scientists, 2018.
Let’s take a closer look at each in turn.
The book “Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models” was written by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson and was published in 2019.
This book describes the general process of preparing raw data for modeling as feature engineering.
Adjusting and reworking the predictors to enable models to better uncover predictor-response relationships has been termed feature engineering.
— Page xi, “Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models,” 2019.
The examples in the book are demonstrated using R, which is important, as the author Max Kuhn is also creator of the popular caret package.
An important perspective taken in the book is that data preparation is not just about meeting the expectations of modeling algorithms; it is required to best expose the underlying structure of the problem, requiring iterative trial and error. This is the same perspective that I take in general and it’s refreshing to see in a modern book.
… we often do not know the best re-representation of the predictors to improve model performance. Instead, the re-working of predictors is more of an art, requiring the right tools and experience to find better predictor representations. Moreover, we may need to search many alternative predictor representations to improve model performance.
— Page xii, “Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models,” 2019.
Feature Engineering and Selection
The complete table of contents for the book is listed below.
- Chapter 1. Introduction
- Chapter 2. Illustrative Example: Predicting Risk Ischemic Stroke
- Chapter 3. A Review of the Predictive Modeling Process
- Chapter 4. Exploratory Visualizations
- Chapter 5. Encoding Categorical Predictors
- Chapter 6. Engineering Numeric Predictors
- Chapter 7. Detecting Interaction Effects
- Chapter 8. Handling Missing Data
- Chapter 9. Working with Profile Data
- Chapter 10. Feature Selection Overview
- Chapter 11. Greedy Search Methods
- Chapter 12. Global Search Methods
I think this is a must-own book, even if R is not your primary language. The breadth of the methods discussed is worth the sticker price alone.

- Feature Engineering and Selection, on Amazon.
The book “Feature Engineering for Machine Learning: Principles and Techniques for Data Scientists” was written by Alice Zheng and Amanda Casari and was published in 2018.
I think this book has the most direct definitions up front of all of the books I looked at, describing a feature as a numerical input to a model and feature engineering about getting useful numerical features from the raw data. Very crisp!
A feature is a numeric representation of an aspect of raw data. Features sit between data and models in the machine learning pipeline. Feature engineering is the act of extracting features from raw data and transforming them into formats that are suitable for the machine learn‐ ing model.
— Page vii, “Feature Engineering for Machine Learning: Principles and Techniques for Data Scientists,” 2018.
The examples are in Python and focus on using NumPy and Pandas, and there are lots of worked examples, which are great. I think this is a good sister book or Python equivalent to the above “Data Wrangling with R” or “Feature Engineering and Selection,” although perhaps with less coverage.
Feature Engineering for Machine Learning
The complete table of contents for the book is listed below.
- Chapter 1: Machine Learning Pipeline
- Chapter 2: Fancy Tricks with Simple Numbers
- Chapter 3: Text Data: Flattening, Filtering, and Chunking
- Chapter 4: The Effects of Feature Scaling: From Bag-of-Words to Tf-Idf
- Chapter 5: Categorical variables: Counting Eggs in the Age of Robotic Chickens
- Chapter 6: Dimensionality Reduction: Squashing the Data Pancake with PCA
- Chapter 7: Nonlinear Featurization via K-Means Model Stacking
- Chapter 8: Automating the Featurizer: Image Feature Extraction and Deep Learning
- Chapter 9: Back to the Future: Building an Academic Paper Recommender
- Appendix A: Linear Modeling and Linear Algebra Basics
I like the book.
I guess I would prefer to drop the math and direct the reader to a textbook. I would also prefer the examples to focus on the machine learning modeling pipeline rather than standalone transforms. But I’m being picky and pushing hard for directly useful code on a given project.

# Recommendations
You have to pick the book that is right for you, based on your needs, e.g. code or textbook, Python or R.
I own all of these books, but the two I recommend are:
- Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models, 2019.
- Feature Engineering for Machine Learning: Principles and Techniques for Data Scientists, 2018.
The reason is I like practical books and I like the R and Python perspectives when I’m figuring out what to try.
A close follow-up would be:
- Data Wrangling with R, 2016.
- Bad Data Handbook: Cleaning Up The Data So You Can Get Back To Work, 2012.
The first is super practical; the second is full of super helpful (yet super specific) advice.
For textbooks, needed for their references by most researchers, I’d probably recommend:
- Best Practices in Data Cleaning: A Complete Guide to Everything You Need to Do Before and After Collecting Your Data, 2012.
