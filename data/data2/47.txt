Why would you ever implement machine learning algorithms from scratch when there are so many provided in existing APIs?
This is a great question. One that must be considered before you write that first line of code.
In this post you will discover a variety of interesting and even thought-provoking answers to this question.
The answers in this post are summarized from the Quora question titled: “Why is there a need to manually implement machine learning algorithms when there are many advanced APIs like tensorflow available?“.
Kick-start your project with my new book Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch, including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples.

# Two Major Reasons To (re)Implement an Algorithm
I think that all of the answers can be broken down into two camps:
- Self Study where an algorithm is implemented as a learning exercise.
- Operational Requirements where an algorithm is implemented to meet needs of a production system.
# Implement Algorithms for Self-Study
Charles Gee gives a great answer from the self-study perspective. He comments:
… suppose that instead of talking about machine learning algorithms, we were talking about sorting algorithms. Sure, many data structures have a sort function that requires little to no coding, but would you really hire a programmer who couldn’t do a bubblesort? selectionsort? insertionsort? mergesort? quicksort? binary search tree?
Charles describes 4 different use cases where it may be highly desirable to implement a machine learning algorithm from scratch:
- As a beginner in the machine learning realm.
- As a researcher in the machine learning realm.
- As a teacher in the machine learning realm.
- As a user of these machine learning algorithms.
# Implement Algorithms for Operational Requirements
Xavier Amatriain focuses on this topic in his answer. He comments:
Let me start by saying that I do believe that any team should default to re-using existing implementations. … However, there are also many reasons why a company may decide implement their own version of an ML algorithm.
Xavier lists 5 reasons to implement a machine learning algorithm, as follows:
- Performance. Open source implementations may be too general and not efficient enough for specific use cases.
- Correctness. There may be bugs or limitations in the open source implementations for specific use cases (such as larger scale datasets).
- Programming Language. Implementations may be limited to specific programming languages.
- Integration. There may be a need to integrate an algorithm implementation into the infrastructure of existing production systems.
- Licensing. There may be limitations imposed by the choice of open source license.
# Summary
In this post, you discovered that there are two major reasons why you might want to implement an algorithm from scratch.
- To learn more about how the algorithm works for self-study.
- To customize the implementation of the algorithm for a production system.
