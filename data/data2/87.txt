2019-08-20
Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, were first described in the 2014 paper by Ian Goodfellow, et al. titled “Generative Adversarial Networks.”
Since then, GANs have seen a lot of attention given that they are perhaps one of the most effective techniques for generating large, high-quality synthetic images.
As such, a number of books have been written about GANs, mostly focusing on how to develop and use the models in practice.
In this post, you will discover books written on Generative Adversarial Networks.
Kick-start your project with my new book Generative Adversarial Networks with Python, including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples.
Let’s get started.
# GAN Books
Most of the books have been written and released under the Packt publishing company.
Almost all of the books suffer the same problems: that is, they are generally low quality and summarize the usage of third-party code on GitHub with little original content. This particularly applies to the books from Packt.
Nevertheless, it is useful to have an idea of what books are available and the topics covered. This can be helpful both in choosing a book for self-study and to get an idea of the types of topics you may want to explore when getting started with GANs.
We will review the following seven books:
- GANs in Action.
- Generative Deep Learning.
- Advanced Deep Learning with Keras.
- Learning Generative Adversarial Networks.
- Generative Adversarial Networks Projects.
- Generative Adversarial Networks Cookbook.
- Hands-On Generative Adversarial Networks with Keras.
Additionally, we will also review the GAN section of two popular deep learning books.
- Deep Learning.
- Deep Learning with Python
If I have missed a book on GANs, please let me know in the comments below.
The books mostly seem to cover the same GAN architectures, such as:
- Standard: GAN, DCGAN.
- Conditional: cGAN, SS-GAN, InfoGAN, ACGAN.
- Loss: WGAN, WGAN-GP, LSGAN.
- Image Translation: Pix2Pix, CycleGAN.
- Advanced GANs: BigGAN, PG-GAN, StyleGAN.
- Other: StackGAN, 3DGAN, BEGAN, SRGAN, DiscoGAN, SEGAN.
Let’s take a closer look at the topics covered by each book.

# GANs in Other Books
The topic of GANs has been covered in other modern books on deep learning.
Two important examples are listed below.
GANs were described in the 2016 textbook titled “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow, et al., specifically:
- Chapter 20: Deep Generative Models.
Section 20.10.4 titled “Generative Adversarial Networks” provides a short introduction to GANs at the time of writing, two years after the original paper.
It would be great to see Goodfellow write a dedicated textbook on the topic sometime in the future.
Deep Learning
GANs were also covered by Francois Chollet in his 2017 book titled “Deep Learning with Python“, specifically:
- Chapter 8: Generative Deep Learning.
In Section 8.5 titled “Introduction to generative adversarial networks,” the topic of GANs is introduced and a worked example of developing a GAN for one image class (frogs) in the CIFAR-10 dataset is covered. Source code is provided here:
