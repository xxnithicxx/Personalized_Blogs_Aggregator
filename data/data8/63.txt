Semi-supervised learning is a learning problem that involves a small number of labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled examples.
Learning problems of this type are challenging as neither supervised nor unsupervised learning algorithms are able to make effective use of the mixtures of labeled and untellable data. As such, specialized semis-supervised learning algorithms are required.
In this tutorial, you will discover a gentle introduction to the field of semi-supervised learning for machine learning.
After completing this tutorial, you will know:
- Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning that sits between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Top books on semi-supervised learning designed to get you up to speed in the field.
- Additional resources on semi-supervised learning, such as review papers and APIs.
Let’s get started.

# Semi-Supervised Learning
Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning.
It refers to a learning problem (and algorithms designed for the learning problem) that involves a small portion of labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled examples from which a model must learn and make predictions on new examples.
… dealing with the situation where relatively few labeled training points are available, but a large number of unlabeled points are given, it is directly relevant to a multitude of practical problems where it is relatively expensive to produce labeled data …
— Page xiii, Semi-Supervised Learning, 2006.
As such, it is a learning problem that sits between supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is halfway between supervised and unsupervised learning. In addition to unlabeled data, the algorithm is provided with some super- vision information – but not necessarily for all examples. Often, this information will be the targets associated with some of the examples.
— Page 2, Semi-Supervised Learning, 2006.
We require semi-supervised learning algorithms when working with data where labeling examples is challenging or expensive.
Semi-supervised learning has tremendous practical value. In many tasks, there is a paucity of labeled data. The labels y may be difficult to obtain because they require human annotators, special devices, or expensive and slow experiments.
— Page 9, Introduction to Semi-Supervised Learning, 2009.
The sign of an effective semi-supervised learning algorithm is that it can achieve better performance than a supervised learning algorithm fit only on the labeled training examples.
Semi-supervised learning algorithms generally are able to clear this low bar expectation.
… in comparison with a supervised algorithm that uses only labeled data, can one hope to have a more accurate prediction by taking into account the unlabeled points? […] in principle the answer is ‘yes.’”
— Page 4, Semi-Supervised Learning, 2006.
Finally, semi-supervised learning may be used or may contrast inductive and transductive learning.
Generally, inductive learning refers to a learning algorithm that learns from labeled training data and generalizes to new data, such as a test dataset. Transductive learning refers to learning from labeled training data and generalizing to available unlabeled (training) data. Both types of learning tasks may be performed by a semi-supervised learning algorithm.
… there are two distinct goals. One is to predict the labels on future test data. The other goal is to predict the labels on the unlabeled instances in the training sample. We call the former inductive semi-supervised learning, and the latter transductive learning.
— Page 12, Introduction to Semi-Supervised Learning, 2009.
If you are new to the idea of transduction vs. induction, the following tutorial has more information:

Now that we are familiar with semi-supervised learning from a high-level, let’s take a look at top books on the topic.
# Books on Semi-Supervised Learning
Semi-supervised learning is a new and fast-moving field of study, and as such, there are very few books on the topic.
There are perhaps two key books on semi-supervised learning that you should consider if you are new to the topic; they are:
- Semi-Supervised Learning, 2006.

Let’s take a closer look at each in turn.
The book “Semi-Supervised Learning” was published in 2006 and was edited by Olivier Chapelle, Bernhard Scholkopf, and Alexander Zien.
