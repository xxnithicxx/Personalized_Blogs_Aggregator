The Weka machine learning workbench is an easy to use and powerful platform for applied machine learning.
Even though it is easy to use, you may still require some help or advice when using it on your own problems.
In this post you will discover resources that you can use to get more help with Weka.
After reading this post you will know:
- About the documentation that is installed with Weka on your workstation.
- Resources online that you can consult to get help with your technical concerns with Weka.
- Where you can go to ask your own unanswered questions about Weka.
Kick-start your project with my new book Machine Learning Mastery With Weka, including step-by-step tutorials and clear screenshots for all examples.
Let’s get started.

# Weka Offline Documentation
Your installation of Weka provides documentation that you can consult for simpler questions around how to use the platform.
Your installation directory contains an HTML file called documentation.html that links to all of the documentation provided with your installation including:
- The Weka User Manual.
- Weka API documentation.
Weka Documentation




The Weka manual provides information on how to use the Weka software.
This includes:
- How to use the Weka command line interface.
- How to use the Weka graphical user interface.
- About the Weka data file formats.
- And additional technical documentation.
The documentation is very good and it is the first place you should check if you have a question about the usage of the Weka software.
Weka Manual
This is the documentation for the Java Application Programming Interface (API).
It is for developers that want to write programs that make use of the Weka Java interface.
The structure and style of the documentation will be familiar to Java programmers as it uses the standard Javadoc format.

# Weka Online Documentation
Weka provides a few online sources of documentation including:
- Weka Wiki
- Weka Mailing List
- Other Official Resources
The Weka Wiki provides helpful how-to articles on a range of Weka topics.
Below are some wiki page that you may find valuable if you are looking to resolve a specific problem:
- Weka Frequently Asked Question
- Weka Troubleshooting
There are a lot of wiki pages, use the search feature to locate pages on a specific topic.
The Weka mailing list is an email list that you can join to interact with the core Weka community.
This includes both answering technical questions about Weka and getting answers to your own technical questions.
There is an etiquette to email lists in general and especially on this email list. A big part of this etiquette is checking if your question has been asked and answered before. You can do this by reviewing the Weka email list archives using the search feature. The archives are rich and I recommend spending some time reading through the history.
Other online resources that you may find useful include:
- Weka homepage
- Pentaho Data Mining Community Documentation
- Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques
# Stack Overflow
The stackoverflow website is a technical question and answer community for developers.
Like the Weka email list, it is good etiquette to check if your question has already been asked and answered before. Use the search feature and pay close attention to the “Related” posts on the right hand side of the page when reading a given question and answer page.
Questions about Weka are tagged with the “Weka” keyword. Filtering questions by this tag allows you to review all Weka related questions.
# Summary
In this post you discovered resources that you can use to get help with Weka.
You learned:
- Your Weka installation includes a Manual with more information about how to use the Weka interface.
- The Weka Wiki is the go-to place for additional technical questions about how to use Weka.
