Stories of how students and developers get started in applied machine learning are an¬†inspiration.
In this post,¬†you will hear about √Ålvaro Lemos story and his transition from student to getting a machine learning internship. Including:
- How interest in genetic algorithms lead to the discovery of neural networks and the broader field of machine learning.
- How tutorial-based blog posts and books helped pass a¬†test for a machine learning internship on a data science team
Let‚Äôs get started.

How a Student Used Tutorials to Get a Machine Learning Internship on a Data Science Team
# Q. Can you share a little about yourself?
I‚Äôm from Salvador, Bahia (Brazil), but currently, I live in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais (also in Brazil).
I am studying Electrical Engineering at the¬†Federal University of Minas Gerais and since the beginning of my undergraduation course, I‚Äôve been involved with software development in some way.
On my first week as a freshman, I joined a research group called LabCOM to help a colleague on his master‚Äôs degree project. He wanted to build a self-managed traffic engineering system in which the network operation and maintenance are performed efficiently and without human intervention. It was built on top of a network simulator and I was assigned to deliver a module to measure some network parameters.
After that, I kept doing things related to software development, like the maintenance of a Linux server on my university, did a bunch of web development courses on sites like Code School, Codecademy and Coursera and a year ago I got my first internship job on a big software company.
It was an amazing experience, because I could work with state of the art technologies, very experienced developers, with whom I learned a lot of good practices and procedures.
When I was going to complete a year there, I received a proposal to work on another company on a Data Science team that was being formed, so I decided to accept that.
# Q. How did you first get interested in machine learning?
Good question‚Ä¶
I first heard of it during one meeting of the research group that I mentioned.
To make a long story short, we were using a genetic algorithm to get some results and, although they were reasonably good, they were taking longer than we could afford to be processed.
To overcome this, a colleague suggested to train a neural network with these results, because once we had a trained model, it would output results really fast.
I was one of the assigned people to implement this solution, but I didn‚Äôt know anything about it, so I googled it.
When I realized that an algorithm could provide the expected output without being explicitly programmed to do so and that it did so by mimicking the human brain, I was like ‚Äúwooooow, that‚Äôs magic!‚Äù
# Q. What books and courses have you tried?
When I decided that I wanted to learn machine learning, my first goal was to start the Johns Hopkins Data Science specialization on Coursera.
After completing two (out of ten!) courses, I let it go. I wasn‚Äôt really needing to apply that knowledge at that moment, I just wanted to learn machine learning and I felt that attending ten courses just to get that knowledge was quite overwhelming. I got distracted with other things and forgot about it.
One year after that, I decided to give a second shot to my ‚Äúlearning machine learning‚Äù quest. I registered myself on the famous Andrew Ng‚Äôs machine learning course on Coursera. It was just one course (instead of ten!), so I thought it would be okay. I really liked his lessons, he knows how to explain complex stuff in an easy way.
I was making progress there quite fast, but after finishing 60%, my first internship started and I started to use my spare time to learn the technologies I was using there. Then my classes at my university started and yes, I never came back to Coursera to finish that course again.
On the next semester, I attended an ‚ÄúArtificial Neural Network‚Äù class at my university. It was a good experience, reminded me of Andrew Ng‚Äôs approach, but I left that class with the same feeling that I still didn‚Äôt know machine learning enough, or that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to say that I know it.
Nobody told me, but I started thinking that in order to say that you can apply machine learning, you have to do some master‚Äôs degree program, because I saw a lot of students doing that.
Oh, another thing that I tried was to learn from articles (research papers). Please, do not do that. That‚Äôs by far the worst approach I have ever tried.
Maybe I was naive, but well, some teachers encourage you to learn that way. I think they are good to find techniques and/or algorithms that do what you want, but after making a short list, leave them and start googling for YouTube videos, blog posts and books.
# Q. How did ML Mastery help you on your journey?
It helped me a lot.
I was doing fine on my previous job when I heard of a machine learning internship opportunity. It was with a company that I had already heard good things about, so I decided to give it a shot.
They gave me three machine learning challenges to do within a week, but since I was working and studying, I just had a weekend to do so.
- The first problem asked us to train a logistic regression model to predict a target variable from a dataset with four features. I was supposed to do an exploratory data analysis, order the most relevant features, estimate the error and do some prediction on a test dataset. For this one I was able to use the knowledge that I already had, just had to learn the Scikit Learn API.
- The second one was quite similar, but the dataset was heavily imbalanced and I had no clue on how to deal with that, so I started googling and I found your blog. It really helped me because I discovered that I could use other metrics instead of the default accuracy, do cross validation, stratified cross validation, undersample and oversample the dataset, compare algorithms, etc. With all this new information, I created a Python module that would do that automatically for me and rank the models based on their F1-Score.
- The third one was the most challenging. I was supposed to find the most relevant features in a classification dataset with 128 features. Your blog posts also helped me with that.
I couldn‚Äôt simply send them the results, I also had to write a detailed report, so your blog posts were fundamental as they helped to fill my knowledge gap very fast.
Now, in my new job, your books are helping me a lot, our manager bought the Super Bundle for us üòÄ
# Q. Congratulations on the new job! Tell us about it?
Thank you!
The company is called Radix and I just joined the Data Science team.
My first project was already finishing when I got there, but was very interesting. It‚Äôs a system called Oil X!pert, which receives as input oil sample of trucks, loaders and other equipment¬†and output both the criticality level of the part and a diagnosis text, as shown in the figure below:
Oil X!pert
Now we‚Äôre using data-driven approaches in other projects to reach better solutions.
Specifically, the project I‚Äôm currently working on aims to find the root cause of fouling deposition on heat exchangers.
