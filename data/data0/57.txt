Machine learning podcasts are now a thing.
There are now enough of us interested in this obscure geeky topic that there are podcasts dedicated to chatting about the ins and outs of predictive modeling.
There has never been a better time to get started and working in this amazing field.
In this post, I want to share the 5 podcasts on machine learning and data science that I listen to.
Let’s dive in.
# Overview
Here’s the short list of machine learning podcasts that I currently listen to:
- Talking Machines
- Data Skeptic
- This Week in Machine Learning and AI Podcast
- Partially Derivative
- Linear Digressions
I’ve tried a number of others, but they have fallen out of my listening cycle.
# 1. Talking Machines
Talking Machines Podcast
This is a high-quality show that includes segments on technique explanation, listener questions and a main interview.
The show brings together Katherine Gorman (a story teller) and Ryan Adams (a machine learning academic).
The interviews are with other academics from NIPS or similar conferences (recorded in batch) and become very technical, which I love.
This might not be for everyone, but I think it is the best-of-breed machine learning podcasts right now.

# 2. Data Skeptic
Data Skeptic Podcast
Episodes from this show can take a different format from mini shows that describe a technique to interview shows.
I love the formats and I love the husband and wife presenters Kyle and Linh Da.
Kyle does a great job of making complex topics easy to understand in the mini episodes. The interviews are often over meaty topics on important topics in modeling.
I look forward to episodes of this podcast in my podplayer.

# 3. This Week in Machine Learning and AI Podcast
This Week in Machine Learning and AI Podcast
This podcast started off with Sam Charrington giving a rundown of top stories in machine learning and artificial intelligence each week.
I loved this format because he did all the heavily lifting for me.
Sam has changed the format and now interviews top machine learning people from industry and academia.
The interviews are interesting and I often learn about a new library or method. But I also would prefer the “this week in machine learning” format to come back.

# 4. Partially Derivative
Partially Derivative Podcast
This is a fun show that started with a bunch of people drinking beer and talking data science.
It has gone through a few iterations of show format but remains fun and funny covering interesting news topics on data science as well as interviews with top practitioners in the field.
Lots of personality in the episodes and good data science chops with Chris Albon, Jonathon Morgan and Vidya Spandana.
Often gets a little too silly for me.

# 5. Linear Digressions
Linear Digressions Podcast
This is a fun show where topics from data science and machine learning are presented in an easy to digest conversational manner.
Both beginners and lay people can enjoy the discussion presented by Ben Jaffe and Katie Malone from Udacity.
Nevertheless, I often pine for the more-technical discussions of talking machines.
