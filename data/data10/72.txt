The method of Lagrange multipliers is a simple and elegant method of finding the local minima or local maxima of a function subject to equality or inequality constraints. Lagrange multipliers are also called undetermined multipliers. In this tutorial we’ll talk about this method when given equality constraints. 
In this tutorial, you will discover the method of Lagrange multipliers and how to find the local minimum or maximum of a function when equality constraints are present.
After completing this tutorial, you will know:
- How to find points of local maximum or minimum of a function with equality constraints
- Method of Lagrange multipliers with equality constraints
Let’s get started.

# What Is The Method Of Lagrange Multipliers With Equality Constraints?
Suppose we have the following optimization problem:
Minimize f(x)
Subject to:
 g_1(x) = 0
g_2(x) = 0
…
g_n(x) = 0
The method of Lagrange multipliers first constructs a function called the Lagrange function as given by the following expression.
L(x, ????) = f(x) + ????_1 g_1(x) + ????_2 g_2(x) + … + ????_n g_n(x)
 Here ???? represents a vector of Lagrange multipliers, i.e.,
???? = [ ????_1, ????_2, …, ????_n]^T
To find the points of local minimum of f(x) subject to the equality constraints, we find the stationary points of the Lagrange function L(x, ????), i.e., we solve the following equations:
∇xL = 0 
∂L/∂????_i = 0 (for i = 1..n)
Hence, we get a total of m+n equations to solve, where
m = number of variables in domain of f
n = number of equality constraints. 
In short, the points of local minimum would be the solution of the following equations:
∂L/∂x_j = 0 (for j = 1..m)
g_i(x) = 0 (for i = 1..n)
# Solved Examples
This section contains two solved examples. If you solve both of them, you’ll get a pretty good idea on how to apply the method of Lagrange multipliers to functions of more than two variables, and a higher number of equality constraints.
Let’s solve the following minimization problem:
Minimize: f(x) = x^2 + y^2
Subject to: x + 2y – 1 = 0
The first step is to construct the Lagrange function:
L(x, y, ????) = x^2 + y^2 + ????(x + 2y – 1)
We have the following three equations to solve:
∂L/∂x = 0 
2x + ???? = 0      (1)
∂L/∂y = 0
2y + 2???? = 0     (2)
∂L/∂???? = 0
x + 2y -1 = 0    (3)
Using (1) and (2), we get:
???? = -2x = -y
Plugging this in (3) gives us:
x = 1/5
y = 2/5
Hence, the local minimum point lies at (1/5, 2/5) as shown in the right figure. The left figure shows the graph of the function.

Suppose we want to find the minimum of the following function subject to the given constraints:
minimize g(x, y) = x^2 + 4y^2
Subject to:
x + y = 0
x^2 + y^2 – 1 = 0
The solution of this problem can be found by first constructing the Lagrange function:
L(x, y, ????_1, ????_2) = x^2 + 4y^2 + ????_1(x + y) + ????_2(x^2 + y^2 – 1)
We have 4 equations to solve:
∂L/∂x = 0
2x + ????_1 + 2x ????_2 = 0    (1)
∂L/∂y = 0
8y + ????_1 + 2y ????_2 = 0    (2)
∂L/∂????_1 = 0
x + y = 0         (3)
∂L/∂????_2 = 0
x^2 + y^2 – 1 = 0    (4)
Solving the above system of equations gives us two solutions for (x,y), i.e. we get the two points: 
(1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2))
(-1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2))
The function along with its constraints and local minimum are shown below.

# Relationship to Maximization Problems
If you have a function to maximize, you can solve it in a similar manner, keeping in mind that maximization and minimization are equivalent problems, i.e.,
maximize f(x)                 is equivalent to                   minimize -f(x)
# Importance Of The Method Of Lagrange Multipliers In Machine Learning
Many well known machine learning algorithms make use of the method of Lagrange multipliers. For example, the theoretical foundations of principal components analysis (PCA) are built using the method of Lagrange multipliers with equality constraints. Similarly, the optimization problem in support vector machines SVMs is also solved using this method. However, in SVMS, inequality constraints are also involved.
