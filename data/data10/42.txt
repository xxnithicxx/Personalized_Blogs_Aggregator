The Python numerical computation library called NumPy provides many linear algebra functions that may be useful as a machine learning practitioner.
In this tutorial, you will discover the key functions for working with vectors and matrices that you may find useful as a machine learning practitioner.
This is a cheat sheet and all examples are short and assume you are familiar with the operation being performed.
You may want to bookmark this page for future reference.
Kick-start your project with my new book Linear Algebra for Machine Learning, including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples.
Letâ€™s get started.

# Overview
This tutorial is divided into 7 parts; they are:
- Arrays
- Vectors
- Matrices
- Types of Matrices
- Matrix Operations
- Matrix Factorization
- Statistics




# 1. Arrays
There are many ways to create NumPy arrays.








# 2. Vectors
A vector is a list or column of scalars.














# 3. Matrices
A matrix is a two-dimensional array of scalars.














# 4. Types of Matrices
Different types of matrices are often used as elements in broader calculations.






# 5. Matrix Operations
Matrix operations are often used as elements in broader calculations.










# 6. Matrix Factorization
Matrix factorization, or matrix decomposition, breaks a matrix down into its constituent parts to make other operations simpler and more numerically stable.








# 7. Statistics
Statistics summarize the contents of vectors or matrices and are often used as components in broader operations.
