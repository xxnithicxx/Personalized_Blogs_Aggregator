Unlike traditional online courses, Foster Provost’s workshops will give you the chance to engage live with a world-class expert and an intimate community of industry professionals. So far we have participants from LinkedIn, Spotify, Ralph Lauren, and many other exciting companies joining. There are only 10 seats left, we would love to see you there too!
Building successful machine learning products requires mastering ML Strategy, including problem formulation, evaluation, and tactics for dealing with stakeholders and project uncertainties. Many ML projects fail not for technical reasons, but because of a poor understanding of the difference between doing ML well technically and actually realizing business impact with an ML solution.
Professor Foster Provost, a leading ML practitioner, entrepreneur, and scholar, is hosting a live interactive course that will help you to master these skills. The course consists of five live online sessions that dive into actionable frameworks and industry case studies. 
The course is also accredited by CPD, meaning you can expense the full cost to your employee learning budget.
