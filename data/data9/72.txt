The concept of the limit of a function dates back to Greek scholars such as Eudoxus and Archimedes. While they never formally defined limits, many of their calculations were based upon this concept. Isaac Newton formally defined the notion of a limit and Cauchy refined this idea. Limits form the basis of calculus, which in turn defines the foundation of many machine learning algorithms. Hence, it is important to understand how limits of different types of functions are evaluated.
In this tutorial, you will discover how to evaluate the limits of different types of functions.
After completing this tutorial, you will know:
- The different rules for evaluating limits
- How to evaluate the limit of polynomials and rational functions
- How to evaluate the limit of a function with discontinuities
- The Sandwich Theorem
Let’s get started.

# Rules for Limits
Limits are easy to evaluate if we know a few simple principles, which are listed below. All these rules are based on the known limits of two functions f(x) and g(x), when x approaches a point k:
Rules for Evaluating Limits
Examples of Evaluating Limits Using Simple Rules
Here are a few examples that use the basic rules to evaluate a limit. Note that these rules apply to functions which are defined at a point as x approaches that point.
# Limits for Polynomials
Examples 1 and 2 are that of polynomials. From the rules for limits, we can see that for any polynomial, the limit of the polynomial when x approaches a point k is equal to the value of the polynomial at k. It can be written as:
Hence, we can evaluate the limit of a polynomial via direct substitution, e.g.
lim(x→1) x^4+3x^3+2 = 1^4+3(1)^3+2 = 6
# Limits for Rational Functions
For rational functions that involve fractions, there are two cases. One case is evaluating the limit when x approaches a point and the function is defined at that point. The other case involves computing the limit when x approaches a point and the function is undefined at that point.
Similar to the case of polynomials, whenever we have a function, which is a rational expression of the form f(x)/g(x) and the denominator is non-zero at a point then:
lim(x→k) f(x)/g(x) = f(k)/g(k) if g(k)≠0
We can therefore evaluate this limit via direct substitution. For example:
lim(x→0)(x^2+1)/(x-1) = -1
Here, we can apply the quotient rule or easier still, substitute x=0 to evaluate the limit. However, this function has no limit when x approaches 1. See the first graph in the figure below.
Let’s look at another example:
lim(x→2)(x^2-4)/(x-2)
At x=2 we are faced with a problem. The denominator is zero, and hence the function is undefined at x=2. We can see from the figure that the graph of this function and (x+2) is the same, except at the point x=2, where there is a hole. In this case, we can cancel out the common factors and still evaluate the limit for (x→2) as:
lim(x→2)(x^2-4)/(x-2) = lim(x→2)(x-2)(x+2)/(x-2) = lim(x→2)(x+2) = 4
Following image shows the above two examples as well as a third similar example of g_3(x):
Examples of Computing Limits for Rational Functions
# Case for Functions with a Discontinuity
Suppose we have a function h(x), which is defined for all real numbers:
h(x) = (x^2+x)/x,  if x≠0
h(x) = 0, if x=0
The function g(x),  has a discontinuity at x=0, as shown in the figure below. When evaluating lim(x→0)h(x), we have to see what happens to h(x) when x is close to 0 (and not when x=0). As we approach x=0 from either side, h(x) approaches 1, and hence lim(x→0)h(x)=1.
The function m(x) shown in the figure below is another interesting case. This function is also defined for all real numbers but the limit does not exist when x→0.
Evaluating Limits when there is a Discontinuity
# The Sandwich Theorem
This theorem is also called the Squeeze theorem or the Pinching theorem. It states that when the following are true:
- x is close to k
- f(x) <= g(x) <= h(x)
- lim(x→k)f(x) = lim(x→k)h(x) = L
then the limit of g(x) as x approaches k is given by:
lim(x→k)g(x) = L
The Sandwich Theorem
This theorem is illustrated in the figure below:
Using this theorem we can evaluate the limits of many complex functions. A well known example involves the sine function:
lim(x→0)x^2sin(1/x)
Computing Limits Using Sandwich Theorem
We know that the sin(x) always alternates between -1 and +1. Using this fact, we can solve this limit as shown below:
