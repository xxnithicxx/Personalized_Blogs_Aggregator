Ensemble learning involves combining the predictions from multiple machine learning models.
The effect can be both improved predictive performance and lower variance of the predictions made by the model.
Ensemble methods are covered in most textbooks on machine learning; nevertheless, there are books dedicated to the topic.
In this post, you will discover the top books on the topic of ensemble machine learning.
After reading this post, you will know:
- Books on ensemble learning, including their table of contents and where to learn more about them.
- Sections and chapters on ensemble learning in the most popular and common machine learning textbooks.

This book provides a technical introduction to the topic of ensemble machine learning written for students and academics.
Throughout the book, special emphasis was put on the extensive use of illustrative examples. Accordingly, in addition to ensemble theory, the reader is also provided with an abundance of artificial as well as real-world applications from a wide range of fields. The data referred to in this book, as well as most of the Java implementations of the presented algorithms, can be obtained via the Web.

The full title of this book is “Ensemble Learning: Pattern Classification Using Ensemble Methods” and it was written by Lior Rokach and published in 2019.
Ensemble Learning Pattern Classification Using Ensemble Methods
This is a direct update to the book “Pattern Classification Using Ensemble Methods” and given a different title.
The first edition of this book was published a decade ago. The book was well-received by the machine learning and data science communities and was translated into Chinese. […] The second edition aims to update the previously presented material on the fundamental areas, and to present new findings in the field; more than a third of this edition is comprised of new material.

# Ensemble Methods in Data Mining
The full title of this book is “Ensemble Methods in Data Mining: Improving Accuracy
Through Combining Predictions” and it was written by Giovanni Seni and John Elder and published in 2010.
Ensemble Methods in Data Mining
This is a technical book on ensembles, although concepts are demonstrated with full examples in R.
This book is aimed at novice and advanced analytic researchers and practitioners – especially in Engineering, Statistics, and Computer Science. Those with little exposure to ensembles will learn why and how to employ this breakthrough method, and advanced practitioners will gain insight into building even more powerful models. Throughout, snippets of code in R are provided to illustrate the algorithms described and to encourage the reader to try the technique.

I believe this is the first book I purchased on ensemble learning years ago. It is a good crash course in ensemble learning for practitioners, especially those already using R. It may be a little too mathematical for most practitioners; nevertheless, I think it might be a good smaller substitute for the above textbook on ensemble methods.

Ensemble Machine Learning
This book is a collection of academic papers written by a range of authors on the topic of applications of ensemble machine learning.
Despite the great success of ensemble learning methods recently, we found very few books that were dedicated to this topic, and even fewer that provided insights about how such methods shall be applied in real-world applications. The primary goal of this book is to fill the existing gap in the literature and comprehensively cover the state-of-the-art ensemble learning methods, and provide a set of applications that demonstrate the various usages of ensemble learning methods in the real world.

Like other collections of papers, I would generally not recommend this book unless you are an academic or one of the chapters is directly related to your current machine learning project. Nevertheless, many of the chapters provide a solid and compact introduction to ensemble methods and how to use them on specific applications.
